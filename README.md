<p align="center">Welcome to this open-source project of Edumia mod.<br></p>

## Current state of the mod
As of now, the mod is in Alpha development stage, meaning this project is still a prototype and it's missing many core features we want to add. <br>

## Licenses of this project
Artistic elements such as textures, models, audio, and more are subject to licensing under either the CC-BY-NC 4.0 license or ARR, because multiple artists worked on it or/and gave permission to use their assets.<br>
For the code, it's under MIT license. You can find both licenses at our github repository.
